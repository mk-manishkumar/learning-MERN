# About

Within this repository, you will find a comprehensive collection of my Web Development journey. It encompasses a wide spectrum of topics, starting from the fundamental building blocks like `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, to more advanced technologies like `React`, `NodeJS`, `ExpressJS` and `MongoDB`. In essence, it serves as a holistic guide to mastering the `MERN` (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack, equipping with a solid foundation and extensive knowledge in the realm of **modern** web development.
